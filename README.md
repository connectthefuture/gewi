The (G)raphical and (E)xtensible (W)idget (I)nterface (gewi)
============================================================

The primary goal of gewi is to provide an extensible, flexable,
and lightweight library for adding GUIs to graphical programs.
The first iteration of this library is built on top of OpenGL,
but it should be a relatively easy task to substitute another
graphic package by changing the rendering classes.
